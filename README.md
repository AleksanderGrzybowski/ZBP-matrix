# ZBP-matrix

This is a C++ matrix library, made for 'Advanced Programming Libraries' course on university. I tried out CLion, this new C++ IDE from JetBrains (definitely not perfect, but okay most of the time) and Catch unit testing library (very simple to use).

You can build it with `cmake . && make`, there are two binaries in `bin` folder, `scratch` is a demo of my code working and `unittest` is a combined bundle of tests.
